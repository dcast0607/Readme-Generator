## *Read Me Generator*

## Description

The intended purpose of this project is to explore the functionality of the "inquirer" npm package. This
package would allow us to prompt the user with a bunch of different questions that would be used to create
a "Read Me" file for the user. This project allows us to explore the different "inquirer" properties
available to us and it also makes it easier for us to construct new "Read Me" file moving forward.
